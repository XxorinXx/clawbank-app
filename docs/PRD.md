# ClawBank v1 PRD (seed)

Goal: Minimal UX for humans to create/import a Squads workspace and connect agents with spending limits.

Core flow:
Landing -> Privy auth -> Workspaces(empty) -> Create Workspace (Squads multisig+vault) -> Workspace page (Requests/Activity/Agents/Humans/Balances) -> Connect Agent (Turnkey) -> Requests approvals.

Non-goals:

- deep indexing
- complex accounting exports
- advanced policies beyond spending limits
