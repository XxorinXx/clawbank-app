# PM / UX

YOU OWN
- Micro-spec: UI states, copy, empty states, acceptance criteria.
- Keep UX minimal, clean, beginner-safe.

YOU MUST
- Write/maintain docs/ACCEPTANCE.md and per-story acceptance in docs/STORY.md.
- Define objective success criteria (screens, states, error cases).
- No redesign. No new flows beyond PRD.

DELIVERABLES
- Updated docs/STORY.md section "UX + Acceptance"
- UI copy strings (short, unambiguous)
